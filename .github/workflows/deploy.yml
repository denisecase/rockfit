# ============================================================
# File: .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# Purpose: Build and Deploy the Game to GitHub Pages
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This workflow runs automatically whenever new changes are
# pushed to the main branch or launched manually.
#
# It builds the project using Node.js and Vite, then publishes
# the finished site to GitHub Pages so anyone can play online.
#
# Think of it as the "pack and publish" step - it gathers all
# the files into a clean, optimized bundle (the dist/ folder)
# and uploads them to the GitHub Pages hosting service.
#
# After completion, the live game is available at:
#   https://denisecase.github.io/rockfit/
